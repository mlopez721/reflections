When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
	Every time I would like to be safe with my backups or when I'd like to share or wanted others to collaborate with my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because I would control that the commits has to be with logical changes 
	more than temporary copies.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
	Branch is a deviation in the local repository.
	Fork is the same but directly on GitHub.
	A clone is a copy of a repository (usually a remote one) in our local device. The changes will apply to the original repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	In this case you can work offline and merge the results afterwards.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	The only or easy way would be working on differents parts of the program. It would be a lot harder without Git and GitHub.
