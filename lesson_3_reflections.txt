When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?
	Every time I would like to be safe with my backups or when I'd like to share
	or wanted others to collaborate with my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because I would control that the commits has to be with logical changes more
	than temporary copies.
